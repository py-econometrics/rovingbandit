    Budgeted Thompson Sampling.

    Adapts Thompson Sampling for budget-constrained settings where arms have different costs.
    Instead of selecting the arm with the highest posterior sample, it selects the arm
    with the highest "bang-for-buck" ratio: (posterior_sample / cost).

    Algorithm:
    1. Sample theta_a ~ Beta(alpha_a, beta_a) for each arm.
    2. Select arm a = argmax (theta_a / cost_a).
